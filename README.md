# PyRisk

A repo of Python Risk tools

## General Use: Making the Histogram plots

First, make sure you have the following modules installed.
The recommended versions are mentioned as well, but any version greater than 
that should suffice.

* scipy.__version__: '1.6.2'

* numpy.__version__: '1.20.1'

* matplotlib.__version__: '3.3.4'

* reqs.__version__: '2.25.1'

### Clone the repo, and find cfb_modules.py

In there, there is a commented section header which looks like this:

___

``` python
#%% Run Script with functions above
# HIT CTRL ENTER HERE TO RUN THE DAY'S DATA.
```

### Make an output directory

Now that you found the script, its time to edit that `output_directory` term.
Make it whatever you wish, but make sure to change that otherwise the script 
will error.


### Prepping the script for the new day data

Within that section, there should be a "day" input set as an int. Increment 
that, then run the script to make the plots go brr.

Ignore all the warnings, they should be okay. (I'll fix them later, that's 
what I get for having sloppy code)

### Posting the album

And that's it. To make the posts, I post them onto Imgur as an album. I'll add 
a screenshot of the current board at the end, and the day priors at the start.

I currently manually sort them afterwards to get accustomed to any changes and 
have fun with the write up myself, but post them however you'd like, even a 
dull post of just the charts is better than no post (I like it, cause I like 
to think it helps the game health overall)
